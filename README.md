## About The Project

Just another random number generator class for C++.

## Features

- Just one header.
- Easy to integrate in your code.
- Each object has his own seed.
- Supports any Integral of Floating point type.
- Mersenne twister algorithm generator (much better than rand() C style).

## Usage and Demo

Just run the demo. It's a very simple class.

Methods are doxygen style documented. Best way to learn is to have a look at the header file.

## License

Distributed under the MIT License.
